ShowPairs highlights the matching pair surrounding the current cursor location.  The main goal of this script is to highlight matching braces and parenthesis making it easier to edit nested expressions.
However, ShowPairs uses the 'matchpairs' global option to determine what it should highlight, so it should be generic enough for other needs.
